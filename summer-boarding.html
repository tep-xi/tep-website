	<p>
	  Take a look at the sky, what do you see? A purple haze,
	  perhaps? A giant flying squid? Millions of microscopic
	  xiohazard symbols? If any of these objects apply to you, then
	  you have found a home...

	<p>
	  Come live at tEp over the summer! In addition to being a very creative
	  and welcoming co-ed fraternity, tEp attractions include:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Large, climate controlled rooms (yes, we have central AC! No more dealing
	  with scorching hot rooms or installing complicated window units)!
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	    Numerous summer social events and gatherings every week!
	  </li>

	  <li>Fully-stocked fridges and
	  an industrial-style kitchen for the ultimate cooking experience!
	  </li>

	  <li>
	  A fully customizable house! Wanna paint murals in your room? Hang stuff
	  from the ceiling? You're free to create your own space here (pending
	  house manager approval)!
	  </li>

	  Check out the answers to some of our frequently asked questions below:
	</p>
      </div>

      <div class="flex-item page-text">

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">How much does it cost to live at tEp?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    For the entire summer: $2500 for a spot in a quad, $3000
	    for a triple, $3300 for a double, and $3500 for a
	    single. This includes access to food and all of our
	    facilities.
	  </p>
	</div>
	
	<button class="flex-item collapsible">What are the move-in/move-out dates?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    June 1st and August 25th, although our move-in date is
	    flexible. If you need to move in slightly sooner (May 27th
	    - 31st), that's fine.
	  </p>  
	</div>

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">What is the deadline to sign a contract?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    The sooner you sign a contract, the more likely we'll be
	    able to give you the room of your choice. We can't
	    guarantee you any particular room, however, since we do
	    our best to maximize the overall happiness of our boarders
	    when assigning rooming.
	  </p>  
	</div>

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">Can I bring my pets?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    tEp does not allow dogs to live in the house. If you would
	    like to bring a cat to tEp this summer, your room options
	    will be limited and you must contact us well in advance to
	    discuss necessary constraints. Fish, nonvenomous reptiles,
	    birds and small rodents are generally acceptable, provided
	    that they are kept in enclosures and cared for/maintained
	    entirely by you.
	  </p>  
	</div>

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">Can my
	girlfriend/boyfriend/significant other/friend stay with
	me?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    Use common sense here. If you would like to have someone
	    regularly sleep over, or have a friend staying with you
	    continuously stay with you for a week or so, that is
	    okay. However, if someone is spending the majority of
	    their nights at tEp, or is staying at tEp continuously for
	    multiple weeks, they will be considered a resident and
	    required to pay rent.
	  </p>  
	</div>

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">If I only need housing
	for part of the summer, can I pay partial rent?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    In short, no. tEp is interested in housing people for the
	    entire duration of the summer. If you accept a spot at
	    tEp, you are committing to paying rent for the full three
	    months regardless of how much you're actually around.
	  </p>  
	</div>
	
	<button class="flex-item collapsible">How does your food plan work?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    tEp regularly purchases bulk orders of food from Sysco,
	    and organizes a communal cooking plan for weeknight
	    dinners. All residents, schedule permitting, will be
	    expected to help cook dinner/clean up to one night a
	    week. This food is open to all tEp residents, and payments
	    towards the food plan is mandatory.
	  </p>  
	</div>
	
	<button class="flex-item collapsible">Can I get a single/double/triple/quad?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    Our rooms are first come, first served. You get to pick
	    your room type (single, double, triple or quad) when you
	    sign a housing contract with us. So, the sooner you commit
	    to living with us, the more likely you are to get your
	    preferred set-up. If you have a preference for a specific
	    room in the house, let us know.
	  </p>  
	</div>

	<button class="flex-item collapsible">Can non-MIT students live at tEp?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	    Yes! But, tEp ensures its ability to collect rent from MIT
	    students on a monthly basis via registration holds. Since
	    we cannot do this to non-MIT students, we require that
	    they pay the entirety of their summer rent before moving
	    in.
	  </p>  
	</div>
	
	<button class="flex-item collapsible">I've never lived in Back
	Bay before. What are my food/travel options?</button>
	<div class="content">
	  <p>
	   tEp is one block away from Newbury Street, a five minute
	   walk from no less than 7 coffee shops, a Trader Joe's, and
	   a 24-hour Star Market, not to mention dozens of
	   restaurants. Additionally, it's about a 15 to 20 minute
	   walk to campus, and MBTA buses run across the bridge almost
	   constantly.
