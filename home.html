	Welcome to tEp, home of the Xi Fellowship!

	<p>
	  One of the most unique and mature aspects of MIT is the
	  diverse range of living opportunities available to fit our
	  student body. You have experienced but the tip of the iceberg
	  until you taste of the great wild world that lies just ex loco
	  parentis.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Tired of the blandness of the dorms? Want something different? tEp is
	  a unique place where you can find a whole new level of independence
	  from the 'tvte.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The rules we follow at tEp are the rules we choose for ourselves. It's
	  a lot of responsibility to govern yourself, but hell, you're an adult,
	  and we're sure you can handle it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  tEp is an amazing place filled with some of the most inventive and
	  creative people at MIT, and is a place where standard operating
	  procedure is to be working on 22 projects at a time, all of them
	  totally rockin'. It's a great, creative, and fun environment where
	  nothing seems impossible, and the founding of your own company, or the
	  discovery of a new planet, seem equally within your reach. Our info
	  page has some of the neat things that have happened because of tEps in
	  the recent past.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Drop by tEp and you might not want to leave. Meet the xisters (brothers), have a
	  grape soda, crash in the Free Willy net, and forget about whatever
	  you should've already forgo... tEp is many things to many people, but
	  for all who live here it's our home - as well as a covert operations
	  center, culinary "research" lab, artistic studio, and philosophical
	  playground. It's not right for everyone - nothing is. Some, though,
	  find a family where they can thrive and grow as never before.</p>

	<h> Who can be a tEp?</h>
	<p>
	  tEps come in all shapes, sizes, genders, colors, languages,
	  interests, and backgrounds. A good tEp is anyone who is
	  committed to making our community a great place. Our house
	  is entirely self-run, and mostly self-made! If programmable
	  LED boards, light shows, secret passage ways, beds hanging
	  from the ceiling and internet-connected laundry sound like
	  your kind of thing, you should come meet us!
