	    I look back and I cannot help but think about how much I
	    learned while living at tep. Yes, I learned to cook and to
	    handle money and to fix things; but, at least for me, that
	    isn't what was important. There were the times when trying
	    to relate to 30 people felt overwhelming and pointless;
	    and there were the times the house was there for me when I
	    really needed it to be.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I learned how to trust a compatriate only because he knew what you
	    were going through. I learned how somebody you don't like can save
	    you. I learned how an awkward ‘I don't know what to say' or a fumbled
	    hug can make all the differance in the world. I learned how to talk to
	    people about things that I really thought I couldn't. I learned that
	    trying to reach out or trying to listen, even if you fail, can
	    honestly help. I learned that I can help those around me whom I love
	    when they need it. I learned that love isn't a sexual thing.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    MIT is a difficult place, and the value of having people around you
	    who know what you are going through is immense. I am a better person
	    for having gone through tep, and I notice the same differences in
	    trust and confidence every day across my colleagues who joined
	    fraternities and those who didn't.

	    quarter of two a.m.. two hours ago, pounding down the
	    street, will and rhett at my heels, the only thought to
	    get to the ice cream shoppe before it closes. wet ground,
	    the occasional car. boston still alive at that time of
	    night, but headed for bed shortly. on the stereo,
	    u2. “still haven't found what i'm looking for”. not
	    exactly true, is it? something special here. got cookies
	    and cream, size medium, and colyn insisted that we go to
	    the supermarket afterward, silly thing really, only we'd
	    go any damned place at that time of night, if you asked.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    across the hall, bo doing that weird thing with his mouth
	    while he studies, some freshman class. he does the same
	    thing when he plays the bass, that chipmunk-cheeked
	    expression. like there's a smile about to burst out. we
	    all get together and play at cocoa sometimes: twenty-two
	    dollar budget for snacks, and a steaming cauldron of cocoa
	    (except the nights someone makes goddamn lemonade, but i
	    guess i shouldn't complain). invite everyone we know over,
	    and this strange assortment of people sort of spills all
	    over our living room. like someone upended a box of
	    weirdos. nice to see so many boys, girls, people from all
	    over the institute. usually a good audience, as well,
	    couldn't tell you why. guess it takes that spark to see
	    what's special about this place. just left-of-center,
	    where it belongs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    i miss edgar. not that we take the fraternity practice of
	    “big brother/little brother” that seriously, mind you: he
	    still owes me that dinner, because a box of mcnuggets
	    isn't going to cover it. i remember last year, the first
	    time i did rush from the other side of the line, how
	    difficult it was. one day just broke down in tears (lots
	    of reasons, i guess, but you know what 19-year-olds are
	    like). he walked by, and didn't say anything, just lay
	    down and hugged me. stayed that way for a while: you need
	    the release of it, sometimes, the tears. afterward we
	    laughed at it all, at how love is love, and little enough
	    to be sad about. was making straight a's in eight classes
	    when he left to join the army. wonder how he's doing?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    something told me it was a little different here, even
	    that first meeting when i arrived at mit. i was ready for
	    water war, for kiddie pools of oobleck, for the hanging
	    couch, the foam room, the lemon pie performance art. i
	    wasn't ready for seppo crying when he moved out, for
	    friday nights with rota and half the house, for eric's
	    marriage at the aquarium, for the fred event, for the five
	    of us sleeping in a basement in chicago, for holding
	    nick's hand when i was sad.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    been wondering lately about a lot of things, same as
	    always: mit doesn't let you off easy. don't know about
	    computer science, or graduate school, or midterms. i know
	    i'm someplace unique, though. “don't dream it's over”
	    plays, a kind of lullaby for a rainy night. feel so
	    completely safe, so at home here. so difficult to just
	    explain why: people ask, i always end up with, “you've
	    just got to be there. to live it for a while.” sounds like
	    a cop-out, but how else can i explain? i heard a man say
	    to me, “i love my brothers,” and as silly as it sounds, i
	    know he meant it: because i feel the same way. every once
	    in a while, things just work. something about these guys:
	    they just work.
